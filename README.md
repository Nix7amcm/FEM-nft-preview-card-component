👩🏻‍💻 [Frontend Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

⚡ This challenge was to build a simple card layout for an NFT preview component, using HTML and CSS.

🚀 I built this utilising CSS Grid to help place the card in the center of the page, and Flexbox to manage the layout of the contents. I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (free version!). Here, I used the frame tool to add a desktop and mobile frame, with the widths that matched the style-guide.md of the project. Then I placed the design images inside, and adjusted the heights of the frames to match the images. I was then able to use a 'rectangle' (Fill #D9D9D9, 50%, and Stroke #FD5E5E, 100%, 1px) that I could move about and resize to measure the sizes of the items and gaps. It really helped!

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to [Figma](https://www.figma.com)! It's so simple to set up a project and learn to use the tools. It definitely made the project easier, with not having to estimate everything! 😃

- Also a shoutout to [frontend practice](https://www.youtube.com/@frontendpractice)! Who's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf-hNuvrLOY) I watched and code I followed to learn how to apply the hover effect to the NFT logo image. Really easy to follow and a massive help! Thanks! 😃
