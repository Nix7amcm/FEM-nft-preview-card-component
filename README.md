üë©üèª‚Äçüíª [Frontend Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

‚ö° This challenge was to build a simple card layout for an NFT preview component, using HTML and CSS.

üöÄ I built this utilising CSS Grid to help place the card in the center of the page, and Flexbox to manage the layout of the contents. I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (free version!). Here, I used the frame tool to add a desktop and mobile frame, with the widths that matched the style-guide.md of the project. Then I placed the design images inside, and adjusted the heights of the frames to match the images. I was then able to use a 'rectangle' (Fill #D9D9D9, 50%, and Stroke #FD5E5E, 100%, 1px) that I could move about and resize to measure the sizes of the items and gaps. It really helped!
